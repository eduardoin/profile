                <p>Guedali Tartakovsky celebrates his 38th birthday. It is only now that Guedali is able to revel in memories of glorious times past. Born a centaur, Guedali describes his family's flight from Russia to Brazil at the turn of the century, the shock of his birth, the loving care of his parents and his sisters, the mounting resentment of his brother, and his extraordinary experiences being raised as a Jew. He meets his life companion--a centauress. Together they embark on a journey to create a place where the human and the wild can live in peaceful coexistence.</p>

                <h3>Far from the Tree, by Andrew Solomon</h3>
                <p>Being exceptional is at the core of the human conditionâ€”that difference is what unites us. He writes about families coping with deafness, dwarfism, Down's syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, or multiple severe disabilities; with children who are prodigies, who are conceived in rape, who become criminals, who are transgender. While each of these characteristics is potentially isolating, the experience of difference within families is universal, with triumphs of love over prejudice in every chapter.</p>

And when he woke and he was 18 again, with all his memories of the next 25 years intact. He could live his life again, avoiding the mistakes, making money from his knowledge of the future, seeking happiness. Until he dies at 43 and wakes up back in college again...</p>
